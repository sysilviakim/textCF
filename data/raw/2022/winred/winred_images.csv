Crowe For Georgia,GA,4/25/2021,"Working Together for a Better Georgia My name is Clint Crowe and I appreciate your support as I seek election to the Georgia House of Representatives for the 110th District. I believe I have a unique and varied background which gives me a vast amount of experience that will be beneficial in this role. As a small business owner and entrepreneur, I am committed to not only keeping Georgia the number one place to do business but also the number one place to start a business because small business is the backbone of our economy. According to the Georgia Department of Labor, 99.7% of business establishments in Georgia are categorized as small (fewer than 500 employees). I know what resources and environments are best for the development and operation of these businesses. As a Realtor, and having been involved with economic development for many years as a member of the Butts County Planning and Zoning Commission, as well as the Development Authority, I understand that private property rights and good, quality, well thought out economic development are essential to a vibrant and healthy community. I am committed to preserving private property rights, as well as focusing on bringing beneficial and job creating projects to our region. And lastly, as a former law enforcement officer, I understand that these first two areas are unimportant if we do not have safe and secure neighborhoods to live in and raise our families. Unfortunately, crime is not going down and the members of our law enforcement community are our sworn defenders who risk themselves to protect us from those who seek to do us harm. I know what they need to help them do their job and I can have a unique input on the creation of laws that are both easier to enforce and beneficial for everyone.

After graduating from Kenwood Academy, one of Chicago's three magnet schools, she attended Beloit College. During her academic career, she enjoyed studying chemistry, biochemistry, German, Japanese, and Brazilian Portuguese. She worked on her own chemistry research with the privilege of using facilities at the University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory.

Friends Of Johnnie Wamsley/Wamsley For House,WV,4/25/2021,"With unemployment reaching record lows in 2019, times remain tough for your everyday West Virginian. Quality jobs remain few and far between leaving the blue-collar families in West Virginia struggling. All the while, we watch the surrounding states flourish with opportunity. The 14th District needs a representative in Charleston that will fight to bring our core values, and work ethic to the table. With a Pro-Coal, Pro-Second Amendment and most importantly PRO WEST VIRGINIA agenda. I will strive to bring West Virginia to the forefront of industry innovations. This is why I want to bring New Leadership for a Better Future. As a small business owner, I have seen firsthand the devastating damage over taxing a family owned business. While I am your Delegate, I will fight to reduce the burdensome over taxation and regulation that occurs on our state level; taxation and regulation that drives good jobs away from the hard-working West Virginians. It is time to allow for employers to create more jobs, giving the ability to earn a wage that allows you to provide for you and your family while keeping your taxes low. Please, join me in bringing our values to Charleston. With your help I can go to the House of Delegates to lower taxes, help create good paying jobs.

Friends Of Nicholas Burlingame,NY,4/25/2021,"Anti-Incinerator | Pro-Term Limits | Pro-Police Friends and Neighbors, Last July, I had my first encounter with the Village of Endicott Board of Trustees. They voted on a new law, which made it impossible for the trade-school I operate to continue to do business in the village. At that point, I started regularly attending board meetings and advocating for my staff and how beneficial we are for the local community and economy. Thankfully, over a short 5-month period we were able to get the issue resolved. Since then I have learned a lot about the Village Board and it triggered my sense of duty and obligation to run for public office. There was such a low public turnout that the board could vote on issues unchecked. The Trustees seemed out of touch with current times and reality. They appear to hold onto the idealistic view that IBM or another large corporation will someday come rescue Endicott. I soon realized, they did not represent me, my family, or my community. We must never forget our storied past, but we need to look to the future. We cannot sit idly by and wait for the next IBM to save Endicott. The change must start with us. When I started my campaign, I knew the odds of winning were low and not for lack of trying. I believed it would be next to impossible to unseat a local career politician who has sat on the Village Board of Trustees for twenty years. I originally had no intention of soliciting supporters for donations; my goal was simply to be a fierce challenger, push the issues that they choose to ignore, hold the board accountable, and make them remember why they ran for office in the first place. Since then, Endicott has changed. Complacency is a thing of the past; Endicott residents have had enough and are calling for action. There have been protests, marches, rallies, press conferences, yard sign movements, community action groups formed, local politicians have been negatively reflected in national news, and citizens are starting to hold elected officials accountable. The majority of our current board is so accustomed to not being questioned, they are silencing the public from speaking at meetings and hiding their heads in the sand. These actions cannot be tolerated. I will fight to restore our right to speak, I will fight for clean industry, I will fight for board term-limits, and I will never stop fighting for a family friendly Endicott. I could not do this without the support of my family, friends and community. Today, I ask for your financial support. Running for office can get expensive. Mailings, yard signs, flyers… none of them are free. I realize due to the pandemic that these are uncertain times, but this is also a turning point and a historic election for Endicott. I am hoping you might be willing to support my campaign with a donation of $100, $50 or even $25. I appreciate all of the inspiration, generous support and prayers. Now, on to November.
